# AE-NMCF
In this paper, we propose a data mining approach for student cognitive modeling, namely autoencoder-like nonnegative matrix co-factorization (AE-NMCF), which roots monotonicity -- a fundamental psychometric theory on educational assessments -- in a co-factorization framework.
AE-NMCF jointly factorizes student-exercise interactions and exercise-knowledge linkages to improve the accuracy of estimating the student's knowledge proficiency. The resulting estimation problem is nonconvex with nonnegative constraints. We introduce a projected gradient method based on block coordinate descent with Lipschitz constants and guarantee the method's theoretical convergence.

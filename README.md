# AE-NMCF
In this paper, we propose a data mining approach for student cognitive modeling, namely autoencoder-like nonnegative matrix co-factorization (AE-NMCF), which roots monotonicity -- a fundamental psychometric theory on educational assessments -- in a co-factorization framework.

AE-NMCF jointly factorizes student-exercise interactions and exercise-knowledge linkages to improve the accuracy of estimating the student's knowledge proficiency. The resulting estimation problem is nonconvex with nonnegative constraints. We introduce a projected gradient method based on block coordinate descent with Lipschitz constants and guarantee the method's theoretical convergence.

We provide the source code for the AE-NMCF and the compared baseline models. Since the Quanlang dataset is private, which is belongs to Quanlang company (https://www.quanlangedu.com/). We cannot make it public.
